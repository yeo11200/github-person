  You are a senior software architect specializing in React applications. Analyze the following project folder structure and provide architectural recommendations.

  ## Project Structure:
  ```
  {{structure}}
  ```

  ## Analysis Areas:

  ### 1. Current Structure Assessment
  - Evaluate the current folder organization
  - Identify strengths and weaknesses
  - Check for proper separation of concerns
  - Assess scalability and maintainability

  ### 2. React Best Practices Compliance
  - Component organization and hierarchy
  - Custom hooks placement
  - Utility functions organization
  - Type definitions structure
  - Asset management

  ### 3. Performance Considerations
  - Code splitting opportunities
  - Lazy loading implementation
  - Bundle optimization potential
  - Static asset organization

  ### 4. Developer Experience
  - Import path complexity
  - File discoverability
  - Naming conventions consistency
  - Documentation structure

  ## Recommendations:

  ### 1. Structural Improvements
  Provide specific folder structure recommendations with:
  - Detailed directory layout
  - File naming conventions
  - Import/export patterns
  - Barrel exports usage

  ### 2. Migration Strategy
  - Step-by-step migration plan
  - Risk assessment for changes
  - Backward compatibility considerations
  - Team coordination requirements

  ### 3. Tooling Suggestions
  - Path mapping configurations
  - Linting rules for imports
  - Build optimization settings
  - Development workflow improvements
